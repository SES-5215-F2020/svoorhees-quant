## Overview of Assignment

The intention of Assignment 5 is to experiment with alternate ways to fit a model. 

For this assignment, I wanted to filter my dataset to get closer at my area of interest --> Development in Bernallilo County. 
Also for the sake of learning more about regressions and best fit, I have decided to compress building type into a binary variable of "SIngle-Family Home" and "Not a single family home."



I'm holding changes made in my last assignment constant which were: 
1. Combining Race and Ethnicity.
2. Combining apartment types into condensed categories.
3. Binning Construction Dates into 20 year intervals

#####  **Load Household Data Set & Shortening Vars**


*Question for grader*:

1. In my data set, 14 people are being coded as "other". When I sleuth through my dataset, I see that they are all Two or More Races & Non-Hispanic. 
In my understanding, line 160 should be covering them,  *RAC1P_label == "Two or More Races" & HISP_label == "Not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino" ~ "Other Race or Multiracial (NH)",* There is probably an error I am not seeing, but can you help me see it? 


2. Carole gave me a great note on how to use the RAC1P & HISP variables instead of the RAC1P_label & HISP_labels to clean up this code. I have not had time to do so, but will do soon.

## **Model** 

Below is a model for Household Income (dependent variable) that takes into consideration When the Structure/Home was built, Race&Ethnicity of the respondent, building type, and age of respondent. 


The base cases are set to:

*Race/Ethnicity:* White (NH) 
*Home Type:* One family home, detached
*decade constructed*: Pre-1940s


## MODEL 1: Baseline
```{r}
model <- lm(HINCP ~ when_built + race_ethn + bld_type + AGEP, data =assignment5_vars)
summary(model)
```


#####  **Analysis:** 
In this model, I am looking at how Household Income varies with race/ethnicity, the decade a structure was built, the type of home it is and the age of the individual. The population I am looking at is a sample of individuals in Bernallilo who have reported non-negative Household Income.

The R-Squared is .0992 which indicates that around 9.9% of the variablility in income (the dependent variable) can be explained by variablity in the independent variables (race, decade home/structure developed, age of individual, race & ethnicity).



## MODEL 2: Baseline
```{r}
model <- lm(HINCP ~ when_built + race_ethn + AGEP + bld_type + when_built:bld_type + race_ethn:bld_type + AGEP:bld_type , data =assignment5_vars)
summary(model)
```



## MODEL 3: What type of building do you live in? 

**Question for Grader, I was interested in doing this type of regression, but didn't have a good sense of how I could do it. I feel I have a moderate understanding of what log-odds (the outputs) would be, but not how the code would look. Online I was able to deduce that I probably wanted glm() with family = binomial, but Im running into the following error. 

```{r}
fit <- glm(bld_type ~ as.factor(assignment5_vars$when_built) + as.factor(assignment5_vars$race_ethn) + HINCP, family =binomial, data =assignment5_vars)
summary(glm.fit)
```


## MODEL 4: What is your age based on Personal Income, Building Type, Race & Ethnicity? 

```{r}
model_4 <- lm(PINCP ~ AGEP + race_ethn + bld_type, data=assignment4_vars)
summary(model_4)

```









## **R Cheat Sheet, References & Troubleshooting**
Hello! I see this area of my assignment as predominantly a resource for myself as I learn R and as a resource to R if I ever need to return after a hiatus (and have forgotten everything I know). 

Feel free to look through, but there is no need to grade anything in this section. 

R Collaborative Flowchart: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_klc5-mA=/


** Sage's Troubleshooting Checklist** <br/>
0. Breathe. <br/>
1. Is everything spelled/cApiTAlized correctly? <br/>
2. Count your parentheses(), commas, and "quotes" <br/>
    2.1 Check poles %>%, | <br/>
3. Have you run the R chunks that are before the chunk with your error. <br/>
5. What is the last thing you changed? Did you make sure you changed it in ALL the places it needs to be changed?<br/>
6. Breathe. Maybe get a glass of water.  <br/>
7. Type in the ?function() into the Console <br/>
8. Do a Google search for "R Markdown" + Your Problem <br/>
9. Try retyping the function from scratch.
10. Try copying and pasting sections in another R Chunk --> Isolate the Problem <br/>
11. Phone a friend. <br/>

**Common Errors:** <br/>
-If you are having a function not found error, check whether or not you have run your libraries. <br/>
-YAML error, check the very beginning of your code
- 

**If you want to see the values of a variable as they appear in your dataset**

#unique(household_data$RAC1P_label) <br/>
#Hispanic <br/>
#unique(household_data$HISP_label) <br/>
